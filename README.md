# redactions_checker_demo

This codebase implements some naive logic for a redaction detector.

## What to do

- [x] Get some more test cases with greater variation in redaction look

## Notes for Later

When you're ready to start manually inspecting images, take a look at [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/guide/quick_start), which you can install with:

```bash

pip install label-studio

```

Once you've got this installed, you can use

```bash
label-studio start
```

to start the app at `http://localhost:8080`.
