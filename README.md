# redactions_checker_demo

This codebase implements some naive logic for a redaction detector.

# What to do

- [ ] Get some more test cases with greater variation in redaction look
- [ ] Make a simple streamlit app to verify app annotations
  - [ ] Viewer for the pdf and annotations
  - [ ] ability to mark annotations that will update the COCO or YOLO file
  - [ ] annnotations should be approved by default. I should be able to override them
  - [ ] I should also be able to add more annotations if need be
